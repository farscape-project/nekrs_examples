This is a test case based on cardinalMonoblockLaminar to verify the NekRS part of the heat transfer problem.
The case is run without coupling to a solid region (the entire domain is fluid and solved in NekRS).
The heat flux from Cardinal is replaced with a fixed heat flux applied uniformly across the entire pipe wall.
